# MainDab OS Requirements

### MainDab only supports Windows 8, 10 and 11!

MainDab does **NOT** have support for MacOS, Android, or iOS. Also, Windows 7 is no longer supported by most exploits, including MainDab.\
\
If you are looking for an exploit that works on MacOS or iOS, you can try [ScriptWare](https://script-ware.com/m) (we are not sponsored by them, this is simply just a recommendation). Both the MacOS and iOS version of ScriptWare comes bundled together for $20 USD. \
\
If you want to exploit on Android, then try using [Arceus X](https://arceusx.com/) (again, not sponsored by them, just a recommendation). It is free to use.\
\
If you're thinking about using MainDab on Linux, then good luck with that.

We can now start downloading MainDab, now that we are clear on why exploits aren't viruses and what MainDab exactly supports.
