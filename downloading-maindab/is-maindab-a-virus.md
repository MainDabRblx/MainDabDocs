# Is MainDab a virus?

### Is MainDab a virus?

As a short answer, **no**. In more detail,

* **MainDab contains code that is used to attach/inject a DLL into Roblox.** Viruses can also inject themselves into applications and processes, which is why MainDab is detected as a virus.
* **MainDab is** **not a bitcoin miner**. **MainDab is not a token logger** (or anything like that). MainDab does not even have any ads or key systems. Exploits with key systems (such as Linkvertise) often have invasive or outright malicious ads attached to those key systems.
* **MainDab is not obfuscated**, unlike the majority of Roblox exploits. You can easily use a .NET decompiler such as [DNSpy](https://github.com/0xd4d/dnSpy), [ILSpy](https://github.com/icsharpcode/ILSpy) or [JustDecompile](https://www.telerik.com/products/decompiler.aspx) to decompile (see what's inside) MainDab. Infact, MainDab's source code is also updated frequently on [GitHub](https://github.com/MainDabRblx/MainDabUISource).
* **Most popular free exploits** **do not have a virus**, such as exploits found on [WeAreDevs](https://wearedevs.net/exploits). If they did, the Roblox exploiting community would have brought those offending exploits down.
