# Adding MainDab as an exception

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Please make sure other antiviruses that you use are disabled!**\
****Other antiviruses such as AVG, Avast, Kaspersky, Malwarebytes, or whatever you use must also be disabled alongside Windows Security. Add MainDab as an exception in those antiviruses as well.
{% endhint %}

### Adding MainDab as an exception

The next step is to add MainDab as an exception in Windows Security. **If you do not, MainDab will be automatically deleted by Windows Security** (or some other issues will occur while trying to open MainDab)**.** \
\
If you use another antivirus other than Windows Security, then you must add MainDab as an exception there too.

First, open Windows Security. Again, go to the Virus & threat protection page.

Add the folder "MainDab" into it.&#x20;

If you placed the MainDab folder somewhere else, add that MainDab folder as an exception. Click "Select Folder", and you're done!

That's all! You should be able to use MainDab now. Or if you're completely new, you can continue onto the UI tutorial...

If you run into any issues, such as MainDab not opening or whatever, please join our Discord for extra support at [https://discord.io/maindab](https://discord.io/maindab) (you've been told so many times to anyways...)
