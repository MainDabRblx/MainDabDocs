# Disabling your antivirus

### Why should I disable it?

Please read [this](https://yohatipynoo.gitbook.io/maindab-documentation/downloading-maindab/is-maindab-a-virus) page to see why MainDab (and most other exploits) aren't a virus.

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Please make sure other antiviruses that you use are disabled!**\
****Other antiviruses such as AVG, Avast, Kaspersky, Malwarebytes, or whatever you use must also be disabled alongside Windows Security.
{% endhint %}

### Disabling Windows Security

Because Windows Security detects MainDab as a virus, you will need to disable Windows Security or you will not be able to use MainDab. \
\
Firstly, navigate to Windows Security. You can probably find this by searching it up in your Windows search bar.

Next, go to "Virus & threat protection".

Click "Manage settings" under "Virus & threat protection settings".

Next, disable everything you see.

**Please note that real-time protection will automatically turn on again!** We will later go over adding MainDab as an "exception" in Windows Security.

That's done! Now to actually downloading MainDab.
