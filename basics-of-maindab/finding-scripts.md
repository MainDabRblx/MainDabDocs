# Finding Scripts

### What exactly is a script though?

A script, in terms of exploits, is a bunch of instructions that tells the executor what to do (in very simple terms). Scripts can do many different things, from simply changing your walkspeed to autofarming in games!

### A script is not an executor!

As previously mentioned, the script is the instruction, while the executor runs the instructions.\
\
**Exploits work in ALL games, not just a certain few of them.**  This is a common misconception that exploits only work in specific games. As said again, the executor runs the instructions.\
\
**It depends on what script you run!** (and of course, the execution power)

{% hint style="warning" %}
Some games have anti exploits. This is known as "patching" scripts. For example, no ordinary ESP would work in Phantom Forces (MainDab's Script Hub does have a script for Phantom Forces)\
\
**Use an alternate Roblox account when possible.**&#x20;

### MainDab Script Hub

If you didn't already notice, MainDab has a general use script hub. It's automatically updated from online sources. **We do not place specific games in our script hub!**

However, MainDab's Script Hub contains more common usage scripts.

### Where can I find scripts?

There are a few places where you can find scripts online! You can paste these scripts into the textbox and run them.

{% hint style="info" %}
Google is your best friend for finding scripts. For example, if you wanted to find a script for Poop Simulator, simply search on Google "Roblox Poop Simulator Script".\


It's not that hard using Google, is it?

Here are a list of places you can find decent Roblox scripts.\
\
V3rmillion - [https://v3rmillion.net/](https://v3rmillion.net/), you must create an account to find scripts (it's worth it though)\

Google - [https://www.google.com/](https://www.google.com/) (honestly quite amazing)\

{% hint style="warning" %}
Some scripts may be unsupported on MainDab. This is due to MainDab using free APIs.&#x20;
