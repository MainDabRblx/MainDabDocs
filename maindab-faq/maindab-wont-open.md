# MainDab won't open

### What does it mean by MainDab not opening?

This means that MainDab will not open when you try run it, NOT when MainDab [cannot inject](unable-to-inject-into-roblox/injection-crashes-roblox.md) or execute a certain script.

### Solution

First, you should try redownload MainDab. If that does not work, then it may be your [antivirus](https://yohatipynoo.gitbook.io/maindab-documentation/downloading-maindab/disabling-your-antivirus) that is preventing you from running MainDab.
