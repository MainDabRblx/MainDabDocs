# Unexpected Client Behaviour

### What does this mean?

This means that Roblox has given you a 1 hour temporary HWID ban. Your account has not been banned from running Roblox.\
\
There is currently no fix for this. You will have to wait for 1 hour for the ban to clear out.\
\
This can be caused by Roblox detecting certain scripts run or Roblox detecting injections. Roblox crashing while trying to inject into Roblox can also trigger this ban.
